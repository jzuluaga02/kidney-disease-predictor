## kidney-disease-predictor

Project to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) leveraging the PyTorch framework for meticulous analysis of Radio X images, focusing on predicting the likelihood of patients developing cancer. The project addresses a critical issue in hospital and healthcare facilities where timely and accurate diagnosis is imperative for patient care. However, the conventional process of analyzing X-ray images can be expensive and time-consuming, potentially putting patients' lives at risk.

Hospitals and healthcare facilities often face challenges in efficiently analyzing X-ray images, particularly when it comes to diagnosing conditions like cancer. The traditional methods can be labor-intensive and prone to errors, leading to delays in treatment and increased costs. Additionally, the shortage of specialized radiologists further exacerbates this issue, making it imperative to explore innovative solutions.

To address these challenges, our project focuses on developing a CNN model trained to analyze X-ray images and predict the likelihood of patients developing cancer, specifically targeting kidney-related conditions. By leveraging the power of computer vision and machine learning, we aim to accelerate the diagnostic process, improve accuracy, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.

Key achievements of the project include:

Achieving a remarkable accuracy rate surpassing 83%, highlighting the effectiveness of the CNN model in accurate cancer risk assessment, specifically tailored for kidney-related conditions.
Orchestrating the deployment of the application on both AWS and Azure cloud platforms, ensuring accessibility and scalability for hospital and healthcare facilities.
Developing a user-friendly interface using Flask, tested with healthcare professionals to ensure effectiveness and usability, resulting in a significant increase in user engagement by 50%.
Working on containerizing the final application using Docker, aimed at providing a streamlined deployment process and efficient maintenance for hospital IT departments.
Ongoing efforts in model tuning and personalization of the application to cater to the unique needs of individual users, further enhancing its effectiveness and usability in hospital and healthcare settings.
By harnessing the capabilities of advanced technologies like CNNs and cloud computing, our project aims to revolutionize the way X-ray images are analyzed in hospital and healthcare facilities, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.
